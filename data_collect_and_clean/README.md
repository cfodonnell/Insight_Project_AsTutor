## data_collect_and_clean

`wyzant_scrape.py` is the primary script for web scraping tutor profiles from Wyzant.com. In order to access the tutor search result page, a short questionnaire must be bypassed manually on the website. Run the script, and complete this questionnaire when the script pauses. Resume the script after the questionnaire is complete. A list of tutor hyperlinks is obtained for a given zipcode and subject. Once a list of unique tutor hyperlinks has been obtained, each link is opened and tutor data is extracted and cleaned before being stored in the postgreSQL database. `proc_funcs.py` contains the functions required to extract and clean data from single tutor html page. `sql_funcs.py` contains the necessary functions for opening a database connection and storing data.
